    <h1>The Cat Says Meow</h1>
    <p>Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. I find your lack of faith disturbing.

      In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. You mean it controls your actions? I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.

      Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!

      I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. What?! The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.

      You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. He is here. Don't underestimate the Force.

      He is here. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Partially, but it also obeys your commands.

      No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possiblyâ€¦ The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
