    <h1>Big Purrs from Emmy</h1>
    <p>A true inspiration for the children. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

      Noooooo! We don't have a brig. Actually, that's still true. Yeah, lots of people did. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.

      Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? And when we woke up, we had these bodies. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.

      Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.

      I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.</p>
